# Covid19-Drug-Discovery-Project
The goal of this project is to create a regression model that can accurately predict the pIC50 value for a given compound given its chemical properties as an input to determine its potential effectiveness in treating COVID-19 in patients. pIC50 is the negative log of the IC50 value when converted to molar and is a measurement of potency of a drug. Values greater than 6.0 are considered effective and values over 9.0 are considered very effective drugs. IC50 is a quantitative measure that indicates how much of a particular inhibitory substance e.g., drug is needed to inhibit, in vitro, a given biological process or biological component by 50%. This dataset consists of 2 different files for a potential drug against the COVID-19 virus. The original file consists of only a SMILES (simplified molecular-input line-entry system - chemical notation that allows the representation of a compound in a way that can be used by a computer) notation and pIC50 constant against the COVID-19 virus for a chemical compound. The second one consists of engineered features using the pubchempy library of Python. This library helps to access the PubChem data. PubChem is a database of millions of chemical compounds. We used this library to fetch the properties of the compounds using their SMILES representation. The dataset is made publicly available by the Government of India as a part of their Drug Discovery Hackathon. There are some potential drugs against the COVID-19 virus in this dataset as suggested by the hackathon organizers.
